This is a rather simple website that I made for a friend. It will display picutres of dogs or bears for them to cheer them up. 

The program itself is one webpage using JavaScript for the backend stuff. There is also a python file I used to quickly read the picutres in folders that I have.

The file structure is not ideal, but I don't have much control of the website I have it hosted on. I would seperate the picutres into seperate folders if I could, but the server I have refuses to read them there.

The website in question can be found here: http://cs.txstate.edu/~mlw125/
