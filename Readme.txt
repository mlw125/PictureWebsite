This is a rather simple website that I made for a friend. It will display picutres of dogs or bears for them to cheer them up. It is silly, but it is also fun to work on.

The script itself is made using JavaScript. Not much into it, but I have used jQuery where I could. The JavaScript handles the button presses and image changes. It will read text files and get the file names for pictures of dogs and bears.

The python file is used to quickly get all the picutres in a file and then write a text file to be read from.

The rest is standard HTML and CSS. Just me practicing both.

The file structure is not ideal, but I don't have much control of the website I have it hosted on. I would seperate the picutres into seperate folders if I could, but the server I have refuses to read them there.

The website in question can be found here: http://cs.txstate.edu/~mlw125/
